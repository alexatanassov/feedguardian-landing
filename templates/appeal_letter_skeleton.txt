Subject: Request for Re-Review – Google Merchant Center Account {{Account ID}}

Hello GMC Team,

We acknowledge the policy related to {{Issue Type, e.g., Misrepresentation}}. We have corrected the root causes and now comply as follows:

1) Price/Availability Parity
- SKUs {{SKU1..SKUn}} verified on {{DATE/TIME}} with attached screenshots show PDP price/availability matching our feed values.

2) Schema Consistency
- Product + Offer schema updated to reflect price, availability, and identifiers accurately (snippet included in evidence pack).

3) Policy Language & Business Info
- We removed/softened claim language and aligned returns/contact details sitewide. Screenshots attached.

Attachments:
- PDP screenshots (price/availability/variant) for {{#}} SKUs
- Returns policy page screenshots
- Schema snippet (Product/Offer)
- Summary of changes

We respectfully request a re-review.

Thank you,
