  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 2025</p>

  <h2>Scope of Service</h2>
  <p>FeedGuardian provides feed parity scans, evidence reports, and appeal drafts for Google Merchant Center accounts. We act as a technical service to help you prepare appeals and supporting documentation.</p>

  <h2>No Guarantees</h2>
  <p>We make best-effort appeals citing Google policies. However, outcomes are solely at Google’s discretion. We cannot guarantee a suspension will be lifted.</p>

  <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Full refund</strong> if no appeal is submitted.</li>
    <li><strong>Partial refund</strong> if an appeal is submitted and rejected twice.</li>
    <li><strong>No refund</strong> if the service was fully completed and evidence pack + appeal delivered.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Limitations of Liability</h2>
  <p>Our liability is limited to the fees you paid us. We are not responsible for lost revenue, ad spend, or other business impacts arising from account suspensions.</p>

  <h2>Contact</h2>
